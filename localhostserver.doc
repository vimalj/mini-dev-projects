Running HTML Files with nodejs, Serve in Localhost:

One of the most common hurdles a beginner's faces is learning how to run an HTML file locally. This article will guide you through the process of serving your HTML files on localhost using the simple, yet effective serve package.

#What is Localhost?
Before we delve into the process, let’s first understand what “localhost” is. Localhost refers to the default hostname that means ‘this computer’, or more accurately, your own machine. In the context of servers, localhost means your computer is acting as the server. When you run a server on your machine, it’s often accessed through the IP address 127.0.0.1 which is mapped to the localhost host name.

#What is Serve?
Serve is a small, robust tool from the creators of Next.js and is a Node.js package that can be used to serve a static site, a single-page web app, or a static file. It's great for running production builds locally before deploying them, and it's also handy for sharing progress with clients, and teammates, or just testing on different devices on the same network.

Prerequisites:
Before we begin, you’ll need to have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your computer. If you haven’t installed them yet, you can download them from the official Node.js website.

Step 1: Install Serve
Open a terminal window and enter the following command to install serve globally:

npm install -g serve
This command uses npm to install the serve package globally (-g), allowing it to be used in any directory on your computer.

Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Navigate to the directory containing your HTML file. You can do this using the cd (change directory) a command followed by the path to your directory. For example:

cd /path/to/your/directory
Step 3: Run the Serve Command
Now, it’s time to serve your project. In the terminal, enter the following command:

serve
This command starts a static server in your current directory, which is now accessible locally on your machine.

Step 4: Access Your Site
After running the serve command, you should see an output similar to this:

   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                            │
   │   Serving!                                 │
   │                                            │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:5000│
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.0.5:5000│
   │                                            │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!       │
   │                                            │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────┘

#
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see your HTML file served as a website!

Step 5: Stop the Server
Once you’re done, you can stop the server by going back to the terminal and pressing CTRL + C.
